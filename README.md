<p align="center"> Welcome to Annonymous. This social media platform allows users to share what's on their mind, while staying completely annonymous.
</p>

## üßê About

I decided to build this application because social media users are often disuaded from posting what's on their mind, because of their fear of public perception. Yikyak, the most popular social media platform for annonymous posting, was removed in the United States. In response, I built this application to give back to the users their ability to stay annoymous while posting.
